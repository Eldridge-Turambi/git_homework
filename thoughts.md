Putting enough time to do all homework, projects, independent practice and also take some off time for mental health
Not being afraid to ask questions, communicate and being okay with not knowing a particular subject; coming in with a learn first mindset
Always try and get a head start on assignments, projects, study, practice time whenever possible; Never procrastinate
Always get some good rest so you can start your day with a fresh and sharp mind that is ready to actively learn
Shoutout to Richard from the 2108 FE program for always being open to answer any of my questions I might have so far in Mod 0
Shoutout to the students brave enough to ask questions that most likely other people are asking about in their head
Shoutout to Mod 0 staff and teachers for a thorough job teaching us valuable information about coding!

I am now learning how to use GitHub push and pull feature aye
